After over 2 years of development, I’m glad to announce that mini2Dx has reached 1.0.0! This is the first major release of mini2Dx considered stable for production use across desktop and mobile platforms.

We’ve seen some games released with mini2Dx, a small amount of contributors and a small community grow over the past two years but now we can finally grow bigger with a solid framework to build 2D games with.

To simplify setting up your mini2Dx project, this release and all future releases will use our fork of the LibGDX Project Generator available for Windows, Mac and Linux on the downloads page. There’s also sample games currently being built out; expect them to be finalised over the next few weeks.

If you’re ready to dive in, head on over the wiki and get started.
