Hey there mini2Dx community,

I've released mini2Dx 1.3.0-rc2 along with a new version of the [mini2Dx Project Generator](https://mini2dx.org/downloads.html).

1.3.0 is the biggest release on mini2Dx yet! It's been in development for a year now and adds a tonne of new features, bug fixes and performance improvements.<!--more--> For more information checkout the [CHANGES](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/blob/master/CHANGES) file on the Github repository. The wiki and javadocs have also been updated for the latest release.

If no issues are found, I'll tag the final 1.3.0 next week :)
