Hey there mini2Dx community,

Today I’ve released 1.1.0 which adds some useful features:

 * Isometric TiledMap support
 * Utility classes for converting Tiled data into collision data

This release also includes bug fixes and updates mini2Dx to use libGDX 1.6.4.<!--more--> For more information, see the CHANGES file in the repository.

As always, any new project generated using the Project Generator Tool will use the latest mini2Dx. If you’re already developing with mini2Dx, see the new wiki page on how to update to the latest version.
