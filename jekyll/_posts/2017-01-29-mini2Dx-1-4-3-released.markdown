Hey there mini2Dx community,

I've published mini2Dx 1.4.3 to Maven Central. This is a small update which prevents the UiContainer from blocking keyUp/buttonUp events if it never received the original keyDown/buttonDown down event.

To update your existing projects, see the [Updating mini2Dx](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/wiki/Updating-mini2Dx) wiki page.
