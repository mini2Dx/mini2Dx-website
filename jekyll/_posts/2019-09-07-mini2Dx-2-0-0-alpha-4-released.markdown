We've just released mini2Dx 2.0.0-alpha.4 which adds a lot of missing methods that previously existed in 1.9.x.

Also, if you're using gdx-ai, there is a now a mini2Dx implementation available via the following dependency:

```org.mini2Dx:gdx-ai:2.0.0-alpha.4```

As always, follow the [updating mini2Dx](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/wiki/Updating-mini2Dx) page to update your version.
