Hey there mini2Dx community,

I've published mini2Dx 1.4.0 to Maven Central. This release mainly focuses on performance improvements to the geometry classes and some API improvements to the UI framework. Note that this release of the UI framework has some breaking changes, the documentation in the wiki has been updated to match this version.
