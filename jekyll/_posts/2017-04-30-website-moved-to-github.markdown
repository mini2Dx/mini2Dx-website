The website has now been moved to the _docs_ folder in the Github repository.

The old maven repo has now been shutdown, all previously releases have been uploaded to Maven Central. If you receive a warning about the URL not resolving during your build, just remove the mini2Dx URLs from the _repo_ section of your build.gradle.

Also, note that anyone using parcl will need to upgrade to 1.1.0.

If there are any issues, please let me know on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/issues).
