Hey there mini2Dx community,

I’ve made a quick 1.2.1 release that fixes Animations flipping Sprites by default ([issue #39](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/issues/39)) – thanks to Jack Sullivan for reporting this. To update to 1.2.1, see the wiki page on how to update to the latest version.

As always, any new project generated using the Project Generator Tool will use the latest mini2Dx.
