Hey there mini2Dx community,

I've published mini2Dx 1.4.7 to Maven Central. This is a small update which adds some minor API improvements:

 * Graphics can now draw TiledDrawable instances
 * Added RepeatedNinePatch which repeats instead of stretches
 * UI element backgrounds can now set backgroundMode to "repeat" or "stretch"

To update your existing projects, see the [Updating mini2Dx](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/wiki/Updating-mini2Dx) wiki page.
