Hey there mini2Dx community,

I've published mini2Dx 1.4.8 to Maven Central. This is a small update which contains some important fixes:

 * Fix UiContainer not clearing active action element
 * Fix Rectangle returning 0,0 as its center

To update your existing projects, see the [Updating mini2Dx](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/wiki/Updating-mini2Dx) wiki page.
