Hey there mini2Dx community,

I've published mini2Dx 1.4.9 to Maven Central. This is a small update which contains a minor fix:

 * Fix @PostDeserialize not being invoked for nested objects

To update your existing projects, see the [Updating mini2Dx](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/wiki/Updating-mini2Dx) wiki page.
