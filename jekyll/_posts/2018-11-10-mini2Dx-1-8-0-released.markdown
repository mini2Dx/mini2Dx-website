mini2Dx 1.8.0 has been released. This release acts as an in-between version of the 1.x API and 2.0 API. It is recommended upgrading to 1.8.0 to ease the transition to 2.0 later on. As previous stated, 1.8.x will only receive bug fixes and optimisations going forward. Once 2.0 is released, 1.8.x will be 100% community-driven.

There are several breaking changes in this release and it is recommended to review the [CHANGES file](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx-ve/blob/master/CHANGES) before upgrading.
