Hey there mini2Dx community,

I've published mini2Dx 1.4.2 to Maven Central. This is a small update which adds some additional methods to the Tiled classes.

For a full changelog see the [CHANGES file](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/blob/master/CHANGES) in the Github repository. To update your existing projects, see the [Updating mini2Dx](https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/wiki/Updating-mini2Dx) wiki page.
