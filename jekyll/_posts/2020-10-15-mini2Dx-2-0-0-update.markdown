2.0.0-alpha.34
-----------------------

We've just pushed 2.0.0-alpha.34. A lot of changes have been going into the alpha versions to support more types of games and more complex usage.

The biggest change is the introduction of `Mdx.timestepMode` which allows developers to change their game's timestep to use normal deltas (time since last frame) or a physics-based timestep implementing the `updatePhysics` method in their game. Previously, mini2Dx forced developers to use a physics-based approach but this is not ideal for all games. Now developers have the flexibility to choose their timestep based on their game.

Artifact ID Changes
-----------------------

Github Packages have started to enforce lowercase for all artifacts. As such, from 2.0.0-alpha.34, the artifact IDs in the your Gradle dependencies will need to be lowercase.

Your dependencies should look like:

```
        compile "org.mini2Dx:mini2dx-core:$mini2DxVersion"
        compile "org.mini2Dx:mini2dx-tiled:$mini2DxVersion"
```

Beta Timeline
-----------------------

We have an internal deadline of December for a project to provide the consoles runtime on. There's a good few optimisations and bug fixes to be done but once everything is stable-ish, we'll be releasing the mini2Dx 2.0 beta along with the new website!

In the meantime, make sure to [join our community on Discord](https://mini2dx.org/community.html)!
