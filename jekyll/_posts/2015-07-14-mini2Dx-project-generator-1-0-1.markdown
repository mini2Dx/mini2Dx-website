We’ve released a new release of the mini2Dx project generator with some core changes to project structure. The following two items are the most important changes to generated projects:
<!--more-->
 * The assets directory is now moved from the android folder to the core folder
 * The source code under the core folder was moved from src to src/main/java

You can read the full changelog on the Github repository.

If you’re using the project generator to generate your projects, make sure to download the latest version from the Downloads Page.
